            <div class=" experience freelancing">
                <h5>Freelancing</h5>
                <p> I have always loved reading and writing since middle school. During high-school, 
                    I had an oppurtunity to become a writer through freelancing and being an 
                    enthusiast, I automatically took it. Although, not books or articles, but I have
                    written several YouTube scripts for emerging YouTube channels.

                <h5>Part-time Teacher</h5>
                <p>During high-school, I became an assistant for my chemistry teacher and 
                    only in a matter of a few months, I was able to secure a job at his tuition academy
                    where I taught young middle school students.

                <h5>Math Olympiad winner</h5>
                <p>During the first year of high school, I was among the few 
                    fortunate students to be selection for the Inter-School Math Olympiad. 
                    With the help of my fellow teammates and great teachers, 
                    we were able to secure the first spot in Calculus.

                <h5>First place in Science Fair</h5>
                <p>I was able to win our Annual School Science fair three times during my 
                    school days. The first win came in 2016 while the other two were back to back
                    wins in 2019 and 2020. Following the success, our team also represented our school in an 
                    inter-school Science Fair where we were able to secure the second spot.
