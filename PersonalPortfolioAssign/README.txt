Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my personal details 
and skills. 

The website has 4 different pages, all connected to one another. The four pages are:

1. Home Page - This page is equipped with my personal information and a 
small section about myself. 

2. Hobbies Page - This page consists of all my hobbies along with a brief 
description about each hobby. 

3. Weekly Schedule Page - This page consists of my weekly timetable. 

4. Experience - This page consists of my past work experiences &
extracurricular activities that I have taken part in. 

All the pages are linked to each other in the top section on the website which 
ensures fluidity and easy switching from one webpage to another. On top of that, 
all my social media pages are also linked in the top section on the website on each and every
webpage.
