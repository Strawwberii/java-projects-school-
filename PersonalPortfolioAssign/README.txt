Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my personal details 
and skills. 

The website has 4 different pages, all connected to one another. The home page 
features personal information along with a brief "who am I?" section. Apart from that, 
the website also has pages for my hobbies, my weekly schedule and experience. Last but not least, 
it is also equipped with links to my main social media accounts. 

The website is made purely using HTML and CSS.
